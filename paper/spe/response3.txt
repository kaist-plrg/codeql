Dear Editor and Reviewers,

Thank you for your constructive comments. We did our best to address them all as follows.

=================================================================

* Reviewer 1

1-1) "Note that a derived fact should not contain any free variables as its argument." ->
"Note that a derived fact should not contain any free variables in its arguments".
==> We revised the sentence as suggested.

1-2) "Therefore, we decided to sacrifice the soundness"  ->
"Therefore, we decided to sacrifice soundness"
==> We revised the sentence as suggested.

=================================================================

* Reviewer 2

2-1) Other comments remain unaddressed. I hope the authors consider addressing them in the final version of the paper.
==> We addressed the comments as follows:

* Benchmark choice
We explained our benchmark choice discussing PyCBench at the beginning of Section 5.1.2

* Novelty of the IR
Because IR is not one of the contributions of our work and is irrelevant to the paper's primary goal, we revised Section 2 to remove misunderstandings about IRs.

* Discussion about extensibility
We included discussion about extensibility in Section 4.6 Discussion.

\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}

\input{tableRQ1-1}

To show the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate
\ours with the following two research questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\req{1}: Feasibility.} Does \ours correctly analyze multilingual
    programs that use various interoperations?

  \item \textbf{\req{2}: Usefulness.} Does \ours correctly analyze inter-language
    flows to detect bugs in real-world multilingual programs?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\req{1}: Feasibility}
We evaluate the feasibility of \ours by dataflow analysis on two benchmark
suites for each of Java-C and Python-C analyses.  For the Java-C analysis, we
use NativeFlowBench~\cite{nativeflowbench, JN-SAF} and real-world JNI Android
apps downloaded from F-Droid~\cite{fdroid} as the benchmark suites.  For the
Python-C analysis, we use ExtModuleFlowBench, which we developed, and
real-world C-Python programs downloaded from GitHub.

\subsubsection{Feasibility: Java-C}
The first benchmark suite for Java-C program analysis is
NativeFlowBench~\cite{nativeflowbench, JN-SAF}, consisting of 23 JNI Android
applications (apps) that use various JNI interoperations.  They contain
sensitive data leakage from {\it sources} to {\it sinks} across language
boundaries via JNI interoperations.  We compare the analysis results of \ours
to those of the state-of-the-art Java-C program dataflow analyzer,
\jnsaf~\cite{JN-SAF}. We use compiled versions for \jnsaf because it targets
compiled JNI programs.

Table~\ref{table:RQ1-1} summarizes the analysis results of \jnsaf and \ours on
NativeFlowBench.  {\bf Benchmark} columns show the benchmark names and {\bf
JN-SAF} and {\bf MultiQL} columns show the analysis results of \jnsaf and
\ours, respectively.  If an analysis reports all data leakages correctly
without any false positives (FP) or false negatives (FN), it is a success
(\cmark).  Otherwise, it is a failure (\xmark).  \ours finds data leakages
correctly for 19 benchmarks but reports false negatives for four benchmarks,
while \jnsaf analyzes 21 benchmarks correctly.  One common failure comes from
string concatenation: {\it native\_complexdata\_stringop} generates a Java
field name by concatenating two string values via a built-in function.  Because
\ours does not handle built-in functions, it fails to analyze the benchmark.
{\it icc\_javatonative} and {\it icc\_nativetojava} leak data via the Android
inter-component communication, which is beyond the scope of \ours.  The
remaining different failures of \ours and \jnsaf come from their different
array analysis policies.  While both {\it native\_leak\_array} and {\it
native\_noleak\_array} store sensitive data in an array, the former leaks the
data, but the latter does not.  Because \jnsaf over-approximates dataflows on
arrays, it analyzes {\it native\_leak\_array} correctly but reports a false
positive for {\it native\_noleak\_array}.  By contrast, because CodeQL
under-approximates dataflows on arrays, \ours analyzes {\it
native\_noleak\_array} correctly but reports a false negative for {\it
native\_leak\_array}.

The results show that \ours can successfully analyze JNI programs that use
various JNI interoperations, and its correctness is comparable with that of
\jnsaf.

The second benchmark suite consists of real-world Java-C Android apps
downloaded from F-Droid, a repository of open-source Android
apps~\cite{fdroid}.  We first downloaded all available apps from F-Droid, and
classified downloaded apps into JNI and non-JNI apps.  Then, we selected all 42
apps that can be compiled without any errors as our analysis targets.  For this
real-world benchmark, we compare the analysis results of \ours to those of
\lees~\cite{LeeASE20}, the state-of-the-art general-purpose Java-C program
analyzer.  We use \lees as a comparison target instead of \jnsaf, since \jnsaf
is not scalable enough to analyze the real-world benchmark.

  \caption{Analysis time of \ours and \lees}
  \label{fig:graph}
\vspace*{-1em}
\end{figure}

Table~\ref{table:RQ1-2} shows the analysis results of \ours on 25 apps that
have interoperations from C to Java.  The first column shows app names with
their indices, the second shows the lines of code, the third shows database
creation time, the fourth shows query processing time, and the fifth shows the
total analysis time.  {\bf C->Java Function Call} and {\bf C->Java Field
Access} show the numbers of C-to-Java function calls and C-to-Java field
accesses, respectively. We collectively call them \emph{JNI uses}.  The
sub-columns {\bf \#Precise}, {\bf \#Resolved}, and {\bf Total} represent the
numbers of precisely resolved, resolved, and the total JNI uses, respectively.
We considered a resolved JNI use as precise, when \ours finds a single target
method or a single field at the JNI use.  \ours resolves 1,076 out of 1,171
(92\%) JNI uses, including 347 out of 404 (86\%) C-to-Java function calls and
729 out of 767 (95\%) C-to-Java field accesses.  In addition, 1,008 (86\%)
resolved JNI uses are precise.  \ours fails to resolve 95 (8\%) JNI uses
because of complex language semantics such as arrays and function pointers, on
which CodeQL does not track dataflows.

By contrast, \lees fails to analyze one app because of an error, four apps due
to the lack of memory spaces, and three apps even in eight hours.  In the
remaining 17 apps, \lees resolves 71\% JNI uses and precisely resolves 46\% of
JNI uses, which shows significantly more imprecise results than \ours.

\ours is scalable in that it can analyze large-scale programs.  The analysis
time was 161.3 seconds on average for each app, including 103.8 seconds for DB
creation and 57.5 seconds for query processing.  DB creation took more time
than query processing except for {\it Graph 89}, and the DB creation time was
almost linear to the code size.  \ours took about 12 minutes at most to analyze
{\it Tileless Map} having about one million lines of code.

Figure~\ref{fig:graph} shows the analysis time of \ours compared to \lees.  The
x-axis denotes the indices of apps and the y-axis denotes the analysis time in
seconds. We omit eight apps \lees fails to analyze.  \lees analyzes 12 apps
faster than \ours, but the difference is less than two minutes.  On the other
hand, \ours analyzes five apps faster than \lees, and \lees spends much time in
summary generation for three apps among them.  In addition, while \lees fails
to analyze all the large-scale apps that have more than about 400,000 lines of
code in eight hours, \ours analyzes about three million lines of code in about
12 minutes.  \lees shows scalability issues due to its complex semantic summary
extraction from C functions.

In summary, the evaluation with the second benchmark suite shows that \ours can
analyze real-world JNI applications more precisely than \lees.  In addition,
\ours is more scalable than \lees in that it can analyze larger apps much
faster than \lees.

\subsubsection{Feasibility: Python-C}
\input{tableRQ1-3}

\inblue{ Similar to previous section, we evaluate our analyzer for Python-C
programs with two benchmark suites where one of them is hand-crafted and the
other consists of real-world programs.  There are several good hand-crafted
Python-C benchmarks, such as PyCBench which was used for
PolyCruise~\cite{polycruise}, but we observed that they do not apply to our
tool because our underlying analyzer, CodeQL, cannot support them. Therefore,
we developed ExtModuleFlowBench, our own benchmark suite consisting of 20
Python-C programs, and used it as our first benchmark suite.} We converted each Java-C
benchmark in NativeFlowBench into a corresponding Python-C program, except for
eight apps containing JNI-specific interoperation features. Additionally, we
made five Python-C programs that contain interoperations specific to Python
Extension Module.

Table~\ref{table:RQ1-3} summarizes the analysis results of \ours on 20 Python-C
programs in ExtModuleFlowBench.  {\bf Benchmark} columns show the benchmark
names and {\bf Dataflow} columns show the analysis results.  \ours analyzes
dataflows correctly for 14 benchmarks, but reports false negatives for six
benchmarks.  \ours fails in {\it complexdata\_stringop} and {\it leak\_array}
due to the same reason for NativeFlowBench.  For the other four benchmarks,
\ours fails to track dataflows for the fields of Python objects.  In the failed
benchmarks, the C code changes the values of the fields in Python objects that
are passed to the parameters of C functions.  \ours does not handle such cases
because the use of a virtual argument node prevents the propagation of changed
values back to the field of the original Python object, and it reports false
negatives for them.

The results show that our approach can analyze Python-C programs using various
interoperations, just like it can analyze JNI programs using various JNI
interoperations.

\input{tableRQ1-4}

The second benchmark suite consists of 13 real-world Python-C programs
collected from public GitHub repositories. Six of them are the analysis targets
of Monat et al.~\cite{sas2021}'s work, and seven of them are a compilable
subset of the targets of Li et al.~\cite{polycruise}'s work.

Table~\ref{table:RQ1-4} summarizes the dataflow analysis results on 13
real-world Python-C programs.  The first column shows repository names, the
second shows the lines of code, the third shows database creation time, the
fourth shows query processing time, the fifth shows the total analysis time,
and the last two columns denote analysis results.  {\bf \#~Resolved} column
denotes the number of resolved API function calls in C code and {\bf Total}
column denotes the total number of Python Extension Module API function calls
in C code.  Because all the API functions take a Python object as the first
argument, we considered an API function call as resolved, when \ours finds its
first argument correctly.

Out of 13 programs, all programs but one were analyzed within the time limit of
300 hours.  The only exception was {\it NumPy}, the largest program in the
benchmark suite.  We inspected the evaluation log and found that the analysis
for NumPy was particularly slow because of the inefficient query optimization
of CodeQL’s query system.  In the remaining twelve programs, \ours resolves
8,082 out of 11,725 (68.9\%) total API function calls.  The main reason for
failing to resolve the rest of the API function calls was the implicit method
calls in Python.  Python code can call some methods implicitly, a class
destructor for example, and C code can register C functions as such implicitly
called methods.  Because \ours does not handle C functions implicitly called in
Python, it fails to resolve API function calls in them.

In summary, the evaluation with the second benchmark suite shows that \ours can
analyze real-world Python-C programs with high precision.  It can precisely
analyze the Python object values that C variables can have.

\input{tableRQ2}

\subsection{RQ2: Usefulness}
We evaluate the usefulness of \ours by dataflow analysis involving
interoperation bugs in real-world Java-C programs and Python-C programs.

\subsubsection{Bugs in Java-C Programs}
For Java-C programs, we show that \ours can detect JNI interoperation bugs in
42 real-world Android apps.  We chose to explore the same JNI interoperation
bugs in our analysis as those used in previous research~\cite{LeeASE20, ILEA}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\it NullDeref}: dereferencing the {\tt null} value of Java in C
  \item {\it MissingFun}: calling a missing Java method from C
  \item {\it TypeMismatch}: declaring a C function with a different signature
    from its corresponding Java native method
  \item {\it WrongSig}: calling a Java method using a method ID with a
    wrong signature in C
\end{itemize}
We implemented a checker to detect the bugs on top of \ours using the query
language of CodeQL.

Table~\ref{table:RQ2} summarizes the bug detection results of 19 out of 42
apps, on which \ours reports possible bugs.  The first column shows app names,
the second and the third columns show the numbers of true and false positives
for {\it NullDeref}, respectively, and the fourth to the sixth columns show the
numbers of true positives for {\it MissingFun}, {\it TypeMismatch}, and {\it
WrongSig}, respectively.  We omit the columns denoting false positives for the
three bugs in the table because \ours does not report any false positives for
them.  We confirmed the true and false positives by manually inspecting the
source code.  We color each cell with non-zero true positives, indicating that
the corresponding application had the corresponding bug kind.

\ours reports 33 genuine bugs and 21 false positives in 19 apps.  It reports
five true and 21 false alarms of {\it NullDeref} in 11 apps, nine true alarms
of {\it MissingFun} in three apps, 17 true alarms of {\it TypeMismatch} in
eight apps, and two true alarms of {\it WrongSig} in two apps.  We manually
checked that the false positives come from various over-approximation of the
analysis. One of the main causes is conditionally sanitized variables.  Many
apps use a code pattern that assigns a value to a variable only if the variable
has the {\tt null} value. Because our analysis does not support
path-sensitivity that analyzes each execution path separately, it reports that
the variable may still have {\tt null} even after the conditional assignment.
By contrast, \lees fails to detect 12 out of 33 genuine bugs due to memory or
scalability issues during analysis.

  \caption{Four kinds of JNI interoperation bugs}
  \label{fig:bugs}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:bugs} demonstrates four kinds of JNI interoperation bugs \ours
detects from real-world apps.

Figure~\ref{fig:bug1} is an excerpt from the app, Graph 89, demonstrating the
{\it NullDeref} bug.  The Java code may call a C function {\tt
nativeInitGraph89} with {\tt null} as its last argument, because the variable
{\tt tmp} has {\tt null} when the method {\tt GetInternalAppStorage} returns
{\tt null}.  The C function calls a JNI function {\tt GetStringUTFChars} with
the value as its second argument, without checking whether it is {\tt null}.
However, because the JNI specification describes that the second argument of
the functions must not be {\tt null}~\cite{getstringutfchars}, the function may
behave unexpectedly.  Note that calling JNI functions with wrong arguments may
introduce various unexpected behaviors, since JVMs do not validate the
arguments because of performance overhead~\cite{hwang2021justgen}.

Figure~\ref{fig:bug2} is an excerpt from the app, ObscuraCam, demonstrating the
{\it MissingFun} bug.  As described in Section~\ref{sec:merging}, JNI has a C
function naming convention for JVMs to link Java native methods to their
corresponding C functions. While a Java class {\tt JpegRedaction} declaring a
native method {\tt redactRegions} belongs to a package
\texttt{org.witness.obscuracam.photo.jpegredaction}, the corresponding C
function is named with a wrong package name
\texttt{org.witness.securesmartcam.jpegredaction}.  When calling the native
method, JVM fails to link it because of the wrongly named C function.

Figure~\ref{fig:bug3} is an excerpt from the app, Document Viewer,
demonstrating the {\it TypeMismatch} bug.  While the return type of a Java
native method {\tt search} is {\tt List<PageTextBox>}, the return type of the
corresponding C function {\tt search} is {\tt jobjectArray} corresponding to
the Java built-in array container. The return type mismatch has no effect on
linking between Java native methods and C functions. However, since it is an
unspecified case in the JNI specification, interoperations via such native
methods may behave differently on different JVMs~\cite{LeeASE20}.


Figure~\ref{fig:bug4} is an excerpt from the app, PrBoom, demonstrating the
{\it WrongSig} bug.  The C code tries to get an ID of a Java method {\tt
OnMessage} with a signature \texttt{(LJava/lang/String;I)V}, but the method has
a different signature \texttt{(LJava/lang/String;)V} with one String argument.
Because the signatures do not match, the C code always receives {\tt null}
instead of a method ID, and this example throws a Java exception. In addition,
it may introduce errors in subsequent instructions when using the return value
without null checking or calling JNI functions without handling the thrown Java
exception~\cite{jniexcept}.

The evaluation shows that \ours can detect various JNI interoperation bugs in
real-world JNI apps better than \lees.

\subsubsection{Bugs in Python-C Programs}

  ...
}
  \end{lstlisting}
    \vspace*{-.5em}
  \caption{One danger-use that \ours did not detect}
  \label{fig:cvxopt}
\end{figure}


For Python-C programs, we show that \ours can analyze inter-language flows to
detect interoperation bugs in 12 real-world Python-C programs.  We chose to
explore the same interoperation bugs in our analysis as those used in Li et
al.~\cite{polycruise}'s work.  The bugs involve two kinds of inter-language
flows: a Python value is passed to C code and used as either (1) an argument to
a ``dangerous'' function, such as \ccode{strncpy}, \ccode{strncmp},
\ccode{vsprintf}, and \ccode{malloc}, or (2) an index to array access.  We call
such flows \textit{inter-uses}.  Among inter-uses, some flows can trigger bugs
or security vulnerabilities, which we call \textit{danger-uses}.  Because
precisely detecting danger-uses is beyond the scope of \ours, we implemented a
detector to find inter-uses on top of \ours and evaluate whether \ours can
detect all the known danger-uses.

Table~\ref{table:RQ2-2} summarizes the inter-uses detection results of 12
Python-C programs.  The first column shows program names, the second column
shows the total number of detected inter-uses, and the third and fourth columns
show the numbers of detected and known danger-uses, if any.  Out of 12
programs, five have known danger-uses.

The result shows that \ours can correctly detect eight of the nine known
danger-uses.  Figure~\ref{fig:cvxopt} shows one danger-use from the program
{\it cvxopt} that \ours did not detect.  The call to \ccode{strncmp} on line
8 is an inter-use since the first argument \ccode{descr} comes from Python
code.  Also, this call is a danger-use because it may incorrectly conclude that
the strings \ccode{descr} and \ccode{"CHOLMOD FACTOR"} are equal, even if they
are not, since string terminator (\textquotesingle \textbackslash
0\textquotesingle) is not considered.  The correct code should use 15
(\ccode{strlen("CHOLMODE FACTOR")+1}) rather than 14 as the last argument.
\ours did not detect this inter-use simply because the function
\ccode{getfactor} was unreachable.  Because no Python test files call this
function, \ours could not find any Python value that \ccode{descr} can point
to. We confirmed that when we manually add a Python test file that calls
\ccode{getfactor}, \ours correctly detects the previously missed danger-use.

The evaluation shows that \ours can detect danger-uses that may
trigger bugs or security vulnerabilities in real-world Python-C programs.

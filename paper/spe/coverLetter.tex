\opening{Dear Editors:}

We are submitting a reserach article manuscript entitled: ``Declarative Static Program Analysis
for Multilingual Programs'' for exclusive consideration of publication as an
article in Software: Practice and Experience.
This article presents a systematic methodology that extends a declarative static
analyzer to support multilingual programs.  The first step is to create a
merged database consisting of multiple logical language spaces. Each language
space stores facts transformed from source code written in its corresponding
language.  Then, the second step is to define language-interoperation rules to
derive facts across language boundaries.  We develop a proof-of-concept
declarative static analyzer for multilingual programs by extending CodeQL,
which can track dataflows across language boundaries. Our evaluation shows that
the analyzer successfully tracks dataflows across Java-C and Python-C language
boundaries and detects genuine interoperation bugs in real-world multilingual
programs.  We believe that our approach is applicable to various multilingual
programs, beyond Java-C and Python-C, and to multiple types of analyses.

\section{Introduction}
- Growing use of multilingual programs

- Example: JNI

- Importance of dataflow analysis of multilingual problem

- Problem: known analyzer for JNI programs are not scalable enough / heavy weight

- We suggest: declarative style dataflow analysis for multilingual program

- because, declarative analysis are known to be light weight.

- First show general approach

- Then show implementation of analyzer for JNI programs, using CodeQL

- Show that our method is 14x faster, have higher precision, and find new bugs

-Contribution

+ Suggest new methodology of using Declarative style dataflow analysis for Multilingual program

+ Implement JNI analyzer with CodeQL

+ Show that it outperforms state-of-art analyzers in terms of speed and precision.

+ Found new bugs(?)

\section{Introduction}
- Growing use of multilingual programs
- Example: JNI
- Importance of dataflow analysis of multilingual problem
- Problem: known analyzer for JNI programs are not scalable enough

- We suggest: declarive style dataflow analysis for multilingual program
- First show general approach
- Then show implementation of analyzer for JNI programs, using CodeQL
- Show that our method is 14x faster, and find new bugs

-Contribution
  + Suggest new methodology of using Declarative style dataflow analysis for Multilingual program
  + Implement JNI analyzer with CodeQL
  + Show that it outperforms state-of-art analyzers, and find new bugs

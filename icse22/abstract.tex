\begin{abstract}
- Growing use of multilingual programs
- Importance of dataflow analysis of multilingual problem
- Problem: known analyzer for JNI programs are not scalable enough

- We suggest: declarive style dataflow analysis for multilingual program
- First show general approach
- Then show implementation of analyzer for JNI programs, using CodeQL
- Show that our method is 14x faster, and find new bugs

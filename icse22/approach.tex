\section{Multilingual Program Analysis using Declarative Static Analyzers}
\label{sec:approach}

In this section, we propose a general approach to perform a declarative
static analysis for multilingual programs.

\subsection{Declarative Analysis for a Single Language}

A declarative analysis~\cite{doop} consists of datafacts and rules:
\[
  \begin{array}{llll}
d & ::= & p(\overline{e}) & \mbox{datafact}\\
e & ::= & \embox{num}~\mid~\embox{string} & \mbox{element}\\
r & ::= & d\ \mbox{:-}\ \overline{\neg^? d} & \mbox{rule}
\end{array}
\]
A datafact ``$d = p(\overline{e})$'' denotes a relation $p$ between elements $\overline{e}$.
An element $e$ is either a number or a string.
A rule ``$r = d'\ \mbox{:-}\ \overline{\neg^? d}$'' denotes that
a datafact $d'$ can be derived from other datafacts $\overline{d}$;
$d'$ holds if all the datafacts $d \in \{\overline{\neg^? d}\}$ hold
and all the datafacts $\neg d \in \{\overline{\neg^? d}\}$ does not hold.

Figure~\ref{fig:overview} presents the overview of how a
declarative-style analysis works for monolingual programs.
The analysis consists of three steps.
First, a given program gets converted into syntactic datafacts.
Second, the rules that generate new datafacts are defined, which
correspond to the implementation of the analysis.
Finally, a declarative language engine evaluates the rules with the given datafacts,
producing an analysis result in the form of a datafact.

\medskip
\textbf{Step 1: Extracting syntactic datafacts.}
The first step is to extract syntactic datafacts from a given source code.
Syntactic datafacts include datafacts about certain AST nodes and
the parent-child relationship between nodes. For example, consider
the following code:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=cpp,xleftmargin=2.5em]
int x = 42 + 43;
\end{lstlisting}
We can define a syntactic datafact of the form ``\datalog{expr(i, s)},''
where \datalog{i} denotes the expression ID and \datalog{s}
denotes a string representation of the expression in the source code.
Therefore, we can extract the following set of expr datafacts:
\datalog{expr(0, "42")}, \datalog{expr(1, "43")}, and \datalog{expr(2, "42 + 43")}.
They denote that \datalog{"42"} is the 0-th expression,
\datalog{"42"} is the first, and \datalog{"42 + 43"} is the second.
Another example syntactic datafact is ``\datalog{subexpr(i, j, k)},''
which denotes that the \datalog{i}-th expression has the \datalog{j}-th
expression as the \datalog{k}-th subexpression.
For example, we can extract the following syntactic datafacts:
\datalog{subexpr(2, 0, 0)} and \datalog{subexpr(2, 1, 1)}.

In a sense, these syntactic datafacts serve as building blocks for the
common Intermediate Representation (IR) of multiple languages.
Compared to other IRs, this declarative-style IR has a few advantages.
First, extracting information from source code in this format does not
require any consideration of the language semantics, which imposes
almost no performance overhead beyond parsing the source code.
Second, the syntactic datafacts can be utilized easily in any other kind of
analysis, since they are simple information that can be freely
manipulated by defining new rules. Therefore, even when we use a different
client analysis, we can reuse the extracted syntactic datafacts
without re-extracting them from the source code.


\medskip
\textbf{Step 2: Defining rules.}
The next step is to define rules to generate new datafacts out of known datafacts.
This step corresponds to actually implementing the algorithm of a
static analysis in a declarative style.
For example, recall that we can define a dataflow analysis
\datalog{flow(a, b)} as the transitive closure of the datafact
named \datalog{step}.
Then, we should define rules for the datafact \datalog{step}.
For example, if the syntactic datafact \datalog{assign(x, val)}
denotes the assignment \ccode{x = val}, then we can define a rule for
\datalog{step} and the assignment as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=myDatalog,xleftmargin=2.5em]
step(a, b) :- assign(a, b)
\end{lstlisting}


% {\color{red}{To make this step applicable to multilingual analysis, we present
% a way to define rules in a ``framework approach.''
% First, we design a framework for a static analysis, which consists of 
% the result datafact which would correspond to the
% final result of the analysis, and some helper datafacts used for calculating the result datafact.
%  Then, second task is to actually fill in the rules for such helper datafacts.

% Let's look at the concrete example of dataflow analysis. First thing we do is
% designing the dataflow analysis framework.  In this framework, the final
% analysis result we want is expressed with the datafact of the form of
% flow(a,b), which means that value of the node a can flow into node b. flow(a,
% b) can be defined as transitive closure of a datafact \datalog{step(a, b)};

% \begin{lstlisting}[style=myDatalog,xleftmargin=2.5em]
% flow(a,b) :- step(a,b)
% flow(a,b) :- step(a,c), flow(c, b)
% \end{lstlisting}
% where the datafact step(a,b) means that there is a direct flow from node a to b.

% Next thing to do is defining rule for the helper datafact, step.  For example,
% let's assume that the syntactic datafact assign(x, val) indicates the assignment
% x = val, then one can define a rule for step to be
% \begin{lstlisting}[style=myDatalog,xleftmargin=2.5em]
% step(a,b) :- assign(a, b)
% \end{lstlisting}
% }}


\medskip
\textbf{Step 3: Evaluating rules.}
The final step is to simply evaluate the defined rules with the given datafacts.
Evaluating the rules amounts to finding all possible
datafacts that can be derived. The rules are usually evaluated in a bottom-up
and modular manner, that is, each rule is evaluated one-by-one, after every
rule it depends on is evaluated.

\subsection{\mbox{Declarative Analysis for Multiple Languages}}

In the following, we illustrate how we can compose two declarative style static analyzers
to perform analysis on multilingual program.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \vspace{2mm}
  \includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{img/overview2}
  \caption{Declarative analysis for multilingual programs}
  \label{fig:overview2}
%\vspace*{-.5em}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:overview2} illustrates the overview of how declarative style analysis can be
extended to multilingual analysis. The main difference is that the evaluator
now gets two sets of syntactic datafacts extracted from both language, and the
rules also should be merged, with taking inter operation-semantics into account by
extending some rules.

In order to easily merge two sets of rules or each languages, two rules should
conform to the same framework, that is, they should have same sets of helper
datafacts (although the rule for deriving helper datafacts might differ).
Given two sets of rules, the first thing to do id to identify the syntactic
parts of program where interaction can happen.  Then, based on the information
regarding these parts, new rules for generating proper helper datafacts are
defined, so that the inter operation semantic is properly modeled.

One thing to note here is that already-defined intra language rules for helper
datafacts and newly-defined inter-language rules can be treated independently;
defining new helper rules can be done without considering or modifying the 
previous implementation.

Let's illustrate this extension with the example of dataflow analysis above.
First, we are given two rules for the helper datafact "step", for each language
respectively:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=myDatalog,xleftmargin=2.5em]
step(a,b) :- step_A(a,b)
step(a,b) :- step_B(a,b)
\end{lstlisting}
In order to take the inter-language dataflow into account, one should find out
how a data of one language can be passed to different language beyond language
boundary.  One way to pass data in one language into another is via function
call, shown as in the example below:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=java,xleftmargin=2.5em]
public void main() { // Language A
  int x = SOURCE();
  B::f(x);
}
void f(int param) { // Language B
  printf("\%d", param);
}
\end{lstlisting}

Here, the variable x in language A is passed to the parameter of a function f
in language B. We can define the datafact to reflect this kind of information,
foreignArgParam(a,b,i), which indicates that a is an i-th argument of a foreign
function call to a function whose i-th parameter is b. In above example, we
could derive the datafact, foreignArgParam(x, param, 0). Using this datafact,
we can add new rule for deriving the helper datafact step as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=myDatalog,xleftmargin=2.5em]
step(a,b) :- foreignArgParam(a,b,i)
\end{lstlisting}
so that dataflow through foreign function call also can be considered in this
framework.

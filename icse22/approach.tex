\section{General Approach}

\subsection{Declarative dataflow analysis}
Consider a language with a function call and field access.
step(a,b) :- localStep(a,b) or functionStep(a,b) or fieldSteo(a,b)
flow(a,b) :- a = b or step(a,c) and flow(c,b)
flow is transitive closure of step.

\subsection{Interopration between languages}
Interopeation can happen by:
Call to a function of another langue, or Accessing field of another language.

\subsection{Extension to dataflow analysis of multilingual language}
We need to extend 3 predicates: callEdge(call, fun), fieldRead(a,b) and fieldWrite(a,b)

\subsection{Static edge and Dynamic edge}
Some edges only require static information, such as function name.
i.e. staticCallEdge(call, fun) :- targetName(call, name) and funName(fun, name)
Some edges require runtime-value of certain variable
i.e.
name = "callback";
callMethod(name, param);
In that case, we perfrom "inner flow analysis"
i.e.
dynamicCallEdge(call, fun) :- flow(name, arg) and funName(call, "callMethod") and
getFunctionArg(call, arg) and funName(fun, name)

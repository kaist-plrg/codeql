\section{Motivation}
This section is Motivation:
it will introduce a simple/generalized multilingual code example,
discuss how previous works perform analysis for this example,
and illustrate some issue for each approach.

Then, we introduce declarative style analysis,
and show hoe declarative style dataflow anlysis can be applied.

\subsection{Multilingual program}
A simple, generalized example of multilingual program.
- function call
- field access

\subsection{Previous approaches for analyzing multilingual program}
Introduce previous approaches for analyzing multilongual program.

\subsection{Declarative analysis}
Introduce declarative analysis, and how we can apply declartive style dataflow analysis
for this example.

\section{Implementation}
We implemented this idea into JNI analzer, using CodeQL.
[Insert picure here]

\subsection{Extract database}
We can extract db of two languages, using CodeQL

\subsection{Merge database}
Merge two database.
Problem: duplicated names
i.e. cpp db has "@expr" database, and java db has "@expr" database.
Solution: add prefix: "cpp\_expr", "java\_expr"

\subsection{Lift library}
Dataflow library for each library already exists.
Each has same structure, but with diffrent impl.
However, they are not compatible yet.
We lift each library's classes and predicates.

\subsection{Merge library}
Add extra edges to lifted library.

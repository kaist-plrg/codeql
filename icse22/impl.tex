\section{Implementation}
In this section, we show how we applied the general idea for multilingual program analysis
into implementing the dataflow analysis tool for JNI programs, using CodeQL.
[Insert picure here]
Figure xx. shows the overall structure of JN-QL. First, it generates database for each language
and merge it to one database. Then, two seperate dataflow analysis library is also
merged into one. Using the merged database and merged library, the user can
qrite a query and evaluate it to get query result.

\subsection{Extract database}
We can extract db of two languages, using CodeQL

\subsection{Merge database}
Merge two database.
Problem: duplicated names
i.e. cpp db has "@expr" database, and java db has "@expr" database.
Solution: add prefix: "cpp\_expr", "java\_expr"

\subsection{Lift library}
Dataflow library for each library already exists.
Each has same structure, but with diffrent impl.
However, they are not compatible yet.
We lift each library's classes and predicates.

\subsection{Merge library}
Add extra edges to lifted library.

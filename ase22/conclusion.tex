\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, we suggested the methodology of extending a declarative style
anlyzer that targets multiple languages into a analyzer that can analyze the
multilingual programs. Our approach is inspired from the observation that the


Based on this approach, we build our prototype implementation \ours on top of
CodeQL.  Using \ours, Also, we find 33 true bugs and vulnerabilities from
real-world applications, 12 of which are from applications that \lees failed to
detect.  We believe that our approach is applicable to analysis for other kinds
of multilingual programs beyond Java-C or Python-C, and to various types of
analysi beyond dataflow analysis.

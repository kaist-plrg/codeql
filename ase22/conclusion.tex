\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclude}
Multilingual programs are often vulnerable to bugs and security issues.
To prevent them, existing tools have leveraged general-purpose
monolingual analyzers, which cannot handle large-scale real-world applications.
To overcome the scalability problem, we propose a declarative-style multilingual analysis
taking advantage of its efficient query-based analysis.
Our prototype implementation \ours built on top of CodeQL
showed better scalability without analysis precision degradation than the
state-of-the-art JNI analyzer, \lees.  Using \ours, we found
33 true bugs and vulnerabilities from real-world applications,
12 of which are from applications that \lees failed to analyze.
We believe that our approach is applicable to various multilingual programs
beyond JNI applications.
